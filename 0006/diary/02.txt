It was Sunday. Our teacher Mr Zhu led us to a park nearby.Usually we go to the park to spend our holiday. But today we went there to take part in voluntary labour.

We got there at nine oâ€™clock. Mr Zhu pided us into three groups and then we began working.

The students in Group One planted trees and watered flowers. the students in Group Two were busy collecting litter left by the tourist. they also cleaned the benches in the park. I was in Group Three. We went to the children's playground and cleaned all the equipment there. We worked very hard.

At about eleven we finished working. We met at the gate of the park. We all felt tired but very happy.
